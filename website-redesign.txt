Executive Summary: A Dual-Audience Web Strategy
The core of this strategy is to maintain Zaktomate's primary focus on the Bangladeshi EdTech and SME market on the main zaktomate.com domain while concurrently targeting international business owners through a dedicated /en/ subfolder. This approach allows for tailored messaging, pricing, and trust signals for each distinct audience without the overhead of managing separate websites. Additionally, specialized landing pages will be created to convert traffic from freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr directly.
This structure balances local brand clarity with a globally competitive, conversion-first approach for international clients.
Part 1: Technical SEO & Site Architecture
This foundation is critical for signaling the site structure to search engines and ensuring the correct content is served to the right audience.
1.1. URL & Folder Structure:
Primary (Bangladesh): zaktomate.com/
This will house all content tailored to the Bangladeshi market.
International (Global): zaktomate.com/en/
This subfolder will contain all content aimed at a global business audience.
Zakbot Page
zaktomate.com/zakbot
zaktomate.com/en/zakbot
1.2. SEO Implementation (hreflang):
Implement hreflang tags across the site to inform Google about the different language and regional versions of pages.
On zaktomate.com/, the <head> should include:
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-BD" href="https://zaktomate.com/" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://zaktomate.com/en/" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://zaktomate.com/" />


On zaktomate.com/en/, the <head> should include:
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-BD" href="https://zaktomate.com/" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://zaktomate.com/en/" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://zaktomate.com/" />






Use canonical tags on all pages to prevent duplicate content issues.
1.3. Analytics & Tracking:
Set up Google Analytics 4 with separate data streams or audience segments for / and /en/ traffic.
Implement conversion tracking for all key calls-to-action (CTAs), differentiating between local and international goals (e.g., "Request a Quote" vs. "Book a Free Consultation").
Utilize heat mapping software (e.g., Hotjar) to analyze user behavior independently for each audience segment.
Implement an A/B testing platform (e.g., Google Optimize, VWO) to continuously test and refine elements on both site versions.
Part 2: zaktomate.com - Bangladeshi Audience Blueprint
This version of the site retains the core brand identity focused on local EdTech and SMEs.
2.1. Overall Tone & Positioning:
Tone: Professional but practical, client-centric, and positioned as a trusted local partner.

About Us Page

Our Purpose

At Zaktomate, we believe AI is more than a tool—it’s a partner for transformation. Businesses across the world are overwhelmed by operational inefficiencies and growing digital complexity. Our mission is to simplify this complexity through intelligent automation that is accessible, customizable, and built for real business impact.
We started Zaktomate with a simple question: How can we make AI practical, reliable, and transformative for everyday businesses? That question guides everything we build.




Our Story

Zaktomate was born in Dhaka, but with a vision that goes far beyond borders. It started with a group of students who weren’t satisfied with how businesses—especially in emerging markets—struggled to adopt AI. Most tools were either too expensive, too complicated, or too disconnected from the realities of running a business.
We asked ourselves: What if AI could be packaged as a service, designed around people—not the other way around?
From that simple question, Zaktomate grew. Today, we are building AI systems and solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and everyday business needs. What began as experiments in automating repetitive academic and content workflows has become a platform for long-term AI transformation—starting with ed-tech and SMEs, and now extending to global clients through platforms like Fiverr and Upwork.
That’s when Zaktomate’s identity crystallized: an AI transformation partner that grows with you.


Our Values

Simplicity – We cut through complexity to deliver clarity and efficiency.
Customization – Every client is unique; our solutions adapt to your workflow, not the other way around.
Affordability – AI should drive ROI, not drain budgets.
Trust – Long-term relationships over quick wins.
Global Mindset – While rooted in Dhaka, our outlook is borderless.

About Us Page(Same as zaktomate.com/)

Our Purpose

At Zaktomate, we believe AI is more than a tool—it’s a partner for transformation. Businesses across the world are overwhelmed by operational inefficiencies and growing digital complexity. Our mission is to simplify this complexity through intelligent automation that is accessible, customizable, and built for real business impact.
We started Zaktomate with a simple question: How can we make AI practical, reliable, and transformative for everyday businesses? That question guides everything we build.




Our Story

Zaktomate was born in Dhaka, but with a vision that goes far beyond borders. It started with a group of students who weren’t satisfied with how businesses—especially in emerging markets—struggled to adopt AI. Most tools were either too expensive, too complicated, or too disconnected from the realities of running a business.
We asked ourselves: What if AI could be packaged as a service, designed around people—not the other way around?
From that simple question, Zaktomate grew. Today, we are building AI systems and solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and everyday business needs. What began as experiments in automating repetitive academic and content workflows has become a platform for long-term AI transformation—starting with ed-tech and SMEs, and now extending to global clients through platforms like Fiverr and Upwork.
That’s when Zaktomate’s identity crystallized: an AI transformation partner that grows with you.


Our Values

Simplicity – We cut through complexity to deliver clarity and efficiency.
Customization – Every client is unique; our solutions adapt to your workflow, not the other way around.
Affordability – AI should drive ROI, not drain budgets.
Trust – Long-term relationships over quick wins.
Global Mindset – While rooted in Dhaka, our outlook is borderless.
